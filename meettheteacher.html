    <h1>Jacqui Hooper</h1>
      <p>I found yoga when I was at dance school back in Australia, it wasn’t my favourite class I must admit. It’s a love/hate relationship for me, but it does feel damn good and keeps me out of trouble.

When it comes to music, If you want om-ing, chanting or whale music, you’ll be disappointed… I love Electronic shark tunes.

When I’m not practicing I enjoy eating, drinking, listening to music, the usual suspects but my guilty pleasure is watching the X factor.

I live by these words “Be the person my dog thinks I am”.
