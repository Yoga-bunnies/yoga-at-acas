<p>Here's the essential information about yoga classes at Acas. If you have a question that's not answered below, please drop us an email: yoga@acas.org.uk</p>

  <h2> What am I paying for?</h2>
    <p>The cost is £60 for a block of six classes. To keep things simple we are asking for a one-off cash payment to cover all six classes. Payment reserves your place. Please give your money to Cate McLaurin or Philippa Newis.</p>

    <h2>What are the dates?</h2>
      <p>Classes are on Wednesdays on the following dates:
        <ul>
          <li>25th April</li>
          <li>2nd May</li>
          <li>9th May</li>
          <li>16th May</li>
          <li>23rd May</li>
          <li>30th May</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>What if I can’t come to a class?</h2>
      <p>The bad news is that we cannot refund your place. The good news is that we have a waiting list of people who are interested in classes. It is up to you to organise a swap and payment with someone from the list. Get in touch and we can tell you who to approach.</p>

    <h2>What time does the class start?</h2>
      <p>Classes start promptly at 5.30pm. Each session lasts an hour.</p>

    <h2>Do I need to bring a mat?</h2>
      <p>No. Please let us know if you need a mat and we can provide one.</p>

    <h2>What do I wear to yoga?</h2>
      <p>Here’s some suggestions:

    <ul>
      <li>Wear comfortable clothes that you can easily move in</li>
      <li>Avoid loose or baggy tops as these can ride up during the class. You may not want to bare all to your colleagues</li>
      <li>You can do yoga in bare feet or socks</li>
      <li>Bring some water with you.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
<h2> What level are the classes?</h2>
<p>These are beginner classes. Whether or not you have tried yoga before, everyone is welcome.</p>
