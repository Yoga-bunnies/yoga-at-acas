          <h2> What am I paying for?</h2>
          <p>The cost is £60 for a block of six classes. To keep things simple we are asking for a one-off cash payment to cover all six classes. Payment reserves your place. Please give your money to Cate McLaurin or Philippa Newis.</p>


          <h2>What are the dates?</h2>
            <p>Classes start on Wednesday 13th June and run for 6 weeks on the following dates:
              <ul>
                <li>13th June</li>
                <li>20th June</li>
                <li>27th June</li>
                <li>4th July</li>
                <li>11th July</li>
                <li>18th July</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Classes start promptly at 5.30pm. Each session lasts an hour.</p>
            <p>These are beginner classes. Whether or not you have tried yoga before, everyone is welcome.</p>

          <h2>What if I can’t come to a class?</h2>
            <p>Bad news: we can't refund your place. Good news: we have a waiting list of people who are interested in classes.<br>
            It's up to you to organise a swap and payment with someone from the list. Get in touch and we can tell you who to approach.
          </p>


          <h2>What else?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>You don't need to bring a mat. We can provide one if you need one</li>
                <li>Wear comfortable clothes that you can easily move in</li>
                <li>Avoid loose or baggy tops as these can ride up during the class. You may not want to bare all to your colleagues</li>
                <li>You can do yoga in bare feet or socks</li>
                <li>Bring some water with you.</li>
